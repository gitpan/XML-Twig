NAME

    XML::Twig - Tree interface to XML documents allowing processing chunk
                by chunk of huge documents.

WARNING

    XML::Twig and various versions of Perl, XML::Parser and expat:
    XML::Twig is tested under the following environments:

    Linux, perl 5.004_005, expat 1.95.2 and 1.95.5, XML::Parser 2.27 and 2.31
    Linux, perl 5.6.1, expat 1.95.2 and 1.95.5, XML::Parser 2.27 and 2.31 
    Linux, perl 5.8.0, expat 1.95.2 and 1.95.5, XML::Parser 2.31 

    Windows NT 4.0 ActivePerl 5.6.1 build 631
    Windows 2000  ActivePerl 5.6.1 build 633
    You need nmake to make the module on Windows (or you can just copy
    Twig.pm to the appropriate directory)

    XML::Twig does NOT work with expat 1.95.4 (upgrade to 1.95.5)
    XML::Parser 2.27 does NOT work under perl 5.8.0, nor does XML::Twig 
               

SUMMARY (see perldoc XML::Twig for full details)

    single-tree mode    
        my $t= XML::Twig->new();
        $t->parsefile( 'doc.xml');
        $t->print;

    chunk mode 
        my $t= XML::Twig->new( TwigHandlers => { section => \&flush});
        $t->parsefile( 'doc.xml');
        $t->flush;
        sub flush { $_[0]->flush; }
    
    sub-tree mode 
        # print all title's in the document
        my $t= XML::Twig->new( TwigRoots => { title => 1 },
                               TwigHandlers => { title => \&list});
        $t->parsefile( 'doc.xml');
        sub list { print $_->print . "\n"; }
    
INSTALLATION

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

NOTES

   It is very much recommended to install Text::Iconv (for easy character
   encoding conversions, at least for versions of Perl pre-5.8) and WeakRef
   (to avoid memory leaks) with this version if you can.
