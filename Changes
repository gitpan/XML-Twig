CHANGES

Changes in 3.08

      The previous fix wasn't enough :--( 

Changes in 3.07

      Fixed the way weaken is imported from Scalar::Util

Changes in 3.06

      Added XML::Twig::Elt trimmed_text and related methods (trimmed_field,
      first_child_trimmed_text, last_child_trimmed_text...)

      Added XML::Twig::Elt replace_with method

      Added XML::Twig::Elt cut_children method

      Added XML::Twig contains_only method

      Fixed a bug in the way handlers for gi, path and subpath were chained
      (Thanks to Tommy Wareing)

      Fixed a bug where entities caused an error on other handlers (Thanks
      to Tommy Wareing)

      Fixed a bug with output_filter used with expand_external_entities
      (thanks to Tommy Wareing)

      Fixed (yet another!) bug with whitespace handling (whitespace, then an
      entity made the whitespace move after the entity) (spotted by the usual
      Tommy Wareing)

      Added an error message when pasting on an undef reference (suggestion
      of Tommy Wareing)

      Fixed a bug in in_context (found by Tommy Wareing)

      fixed dependencies (no check with 5.8.0, added Scalar::Util
      as a possible source for weaken)

      Added no_prolog option to XML:Twig::new

      Tested build on Windows (thanks to Cory Trese and Josh Hawkins)


    Changed in 3.05

      Added _ALPHA_ SAX export methods: 
        XML::Twig toSAX1, toSAX2, flush_toSAX1, flush_toSAX2
	XML::Twig::Elt toSAX1, toSAX2

      The following gotchas apply:

        - these methods work only for documents that are completely
          loaded by XML::Twig (ie if you use twig_roots the data
          outside of the roots will not be output as SAX). 
        - SAX1 support is a bit dodgy: the encoding is not preserved
	  (it is always set to 'UTF-8'),
	- locator is not supported (and probably will not, what's the 
	  location of a newly created element?)

      Also when exporting SAX you should consider setting Twig to a 
      mode where all aspects of the XML are treated as nodes by XML::Twig,
      by setting the following options when you create the twig:
      comments => 'process', pi => 'process', keep_spaces => 1
       
     
      twig_print_outside_roots now supports a file handle ref as argument:
      the untouched part of the tree will be output to the filehandle:

      Added the 'indented_c' style that gives a slightly more compact pretty
      print than 'indented': the end tags are on the same line as the 
      preceeding text (suggestion of Hugh Myers)
     
      Added option in get_xpath (aka find_nodes) to apply the query to
      a list of elements 

      Added processing of conditions on the current node in get_xpath:
      my @result= get_xpath( q{.[@att="val"]});
      This is of course mostly useful with the previous option.
      The idea stemmed from a post from Liam Quin to the perl-xml list

      Added XML::Twig xml_version, set_xml_version, standalone, set_standalone
      methods on the XML declaration

      Fixed a bug in change_gi (which simply did not work at all), found
      by Ron Hayden.

      Fixed bug in space handling with CDATA (spaces before the CDATA section
      were moved to within the section), comments and PI's

      Fixed bug in parse_url (exit was not called at the end of the child),
      found by David Kulp

      Cleanup a bit the code that parses xpath expressions (still some work 
      to be done on this though), fixed a bug with last, found by Roel de Cock

      Fixed the SYNOPSIS (parsefile is used to parse files, spotted by 
      e.sammer)

      Fixed a bug in pretty printing (reported by Zhu Zhou)

      Fixed a bugin the install: the Makefile now uses the same perl used 
      to perl Makefile.PL to run speedup and check_optional_modules 
      (reported by Ralf Santos)

      Fixed bugs in pretty printing when using flush, trying to figure out
      as well as possible if an element contains other elements or text 
      (there is still a gotcha, see the BUGS section in the docs) 

      Fixed a bug that caused the XML declaration and the DTD not to be reset
      between parses

      Improved the conversion functions (errors are now reported when the
      function is created and not when it is first used)

      Added the output_encoding option to XML::Twig->new, which allows 
      specifying an encoding for the output: the conversion filter is
      created using Encode (perl 5.8.0) Text::Iconv or Unicode::* The
      XML declaration is also updated

      #CDATA and #ENT can now be used in handler expressions

      added XML::Twig::Elt remove_cdata method, which turns CDATA sections
      into regular PCDATA elements

      set_asis can now be used to output CDATA sections un-escaped (and without
      the CDATA section markers) 

    Changed in 3.04

      Fixed handlers for XML::Parser 2.27 so the module can pass the tests

    Changed in 3.03

      fixed bugs in entity handling in twig_roots mode

      added the ignore_elts option, to skip completely elements

      enhanced the XPath-like syntax in navigation and get_xpath
      methods: added operators (>, < ...)

      fixed [RT 168]: setTwigHandler failed when no handler was already set
      (thanks to Jerry)
      
      turned %valid_option into a package global so AnyData can access it
      
      fixed a bug in sprint that prevented it from working with filters

      fixed a bug in erase when erasing an empty element that was the
      last child of its parent ([RT390], thanks to Julian Arnold)
      
      copy now correctly copies the asis status of elements

      fixed typos on the docs (thanks to Shlomo Yona)

      added tests (for erase and entities in twig_roots mode)

    Changed in 3.02

      Tweaked speedup to replace constructs that did not work in
      perl 5.005003

    Changed in 3.01
    
      Fixed the directory name in the tar file 

    Changed in 3.00

      WARNING: THIS CHANGE IS NOT BACKWARD COMPATIBLE

      But it is The Right Thing To Do

      In normal mode (when KeepEncoding is not used) the XML data is
      now stored as parsed by XML::Parser, ie the base entities are
      expanded. The "print" methods (print, sprint and flush, plus the
      new xml_string, pcdata_xml_string and att_xml_string) return the
      data in XML-escaped form: & and < are escaped in PCDATA and
      &, < and the quote (" by default) are turned to &amp; &lt; and
      &quot; (or &apos; if the quote is '). The "text" methods (text,
      att and pcdata) return the stored text as is.
      So if you want to output XML you should use the "print" methods
      and if you want to output text you should use the "text" methods.

      Note that this breaks the trick consisting in adding tags to the
      content of an element: $elt->prefix( "<b>") no longer adds a <b>
      tag before an element. $elt->print will now output "&lt;b>...".
      (but you can still use it by marking those elements as 'asis').
      It also fixes the annoying &apos; thingie that used to replace '
      in the data. 

      When the KeepEncoding option is used this is not true, the data
      is stored asis, base entities are kept un-escaped.

      Note that KeepEncoding is a global setting, if you use several twigs,
      some with KeepEncoding and some without then you will have to manually
      set the option using the set_keep_encoding method, otherwise the last
      XML::Twig::new call will have set it

      In addition when the KeepEncoding option is used the start tag is
      parsed using a custom function parse_start_tag, which works only
      for 1-byte encodings (it is regexp-based). This method can be 
      overridden using the ParseStartTag (or parse_start_tag) option
      when creating the twig. This function takes the original string as
      input and returns the gi and the attributes (in a hash).
      If you write a function that works for multi-byte encodings I would
      very much appreciate if you could send it back to me so I can add it
      to the module, so other users can benefit from it.

     An additional option ExpansExternalEnts will expand external entity
     references to their text (in the output, the text stored is &ent;).

    Added

      When handlers (twig_handlers or start_tag_handlers) are called
      $_ is set to the element node, so quick hacks look better:
      
      my $t= new XML::Twig( twig_handlers => 
               { elt => sub { print $_->att( 'id'), ": ", $_->text, "\n"; } }
	                  );

      XML::Twig dispose method which properly reclaims all the memory
        used by the object (useful if you don't have WeakRef installed)

      XML::Twig and XML::Twig::Elt ignore methods, which can be called
        from a start_tag_handlers handler and cause the element (or the
        current element if called on a twig) to be ignored by the 
        parsing

      XML::Twig parse_start_tag option that overrides the default function
        used to parse start tags when KeepEncoding is used

      XML::Twig::Elt xml_string, pcdata_xml_string and att_xml_string
        all return an XML-escaped string for an element (including 
	sub-elements and their tags but not the enclosing tags for the 
	element), a #PCDATA element and an attribute

      XML::Twig::Elt methods tag and set_tag, equivalent respectively
        to gi and set_gi
      
      XML::Twig and XML::Twig::Elt set_keep_encoding methods can be used
        to set the keep_encoding value if you use several twigs with 
        different keep_encoding options

      Option names for XML::Twig::new are now checked (a warning is output
        if the option is not a valid one);

      when using pretty_print nice or indented keep_spaces_in is now checked
        so the elements within an element listed in keep_spaces_in are not
        indented

      XML::Twig::Elt insert_new_elt method that does a new and a paste

      XML::Twig::Elt split_at method splits a #PCDATA element in 2

      XML::Twig::Elt split method splits all the text descendants of an 
        element, on a regep, wrapping text captured in brackets in the
        regexp in a specified element, all elements are returned 

      XML::Twig::Elt mark method is similar to the split method, except
        that only newly created elements (matched by the regexp) are
        returned

      XML::Twig::Elt get_type method returns #ELT for elements and the gi
        (#PCDATA, #CDATA...) otherwise

      XML::Twig::Elt is_elt returns the gi if the element is a real element
         and 0 if it is #PCDATA, #CDATA...
      
      XML::Twig::Elt contains_only_text returns 1 if the element contains no
         "real" element (is_field is another name for it)

      First implementation of the output_filter option which filters the
      text before it is output by the print, sprint, flush and text methods
      (only works for print at the moment, and still under test with various
      versions of XML::Parser). Standard filters are also available

      Example:
        
        #!/bin/perl -w
        use strict;
        use XML::Twig;

        my $t = new XML::Twig(output_filter => 'latin1');
        $t->parse( \*DATA);
        $t->print;
 
        __DATA__
        <?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>
        <docé té="valué">Un homme soupçonné d'être impliqué dans la mort 
             d'un motard de la police, renversé</docé>

      The 'latin1', 'html' and 'safe' filters are predefined, you can also
      build additional filters using Iconv (requires text::Iconv) and 
      Unicode::String (requires Unicode::String and Unicode::Map8):

      my $conv = XML::Twig::iconv_convert( 'latin1');
      my $t = new XML::Twig(output_filter => $conv);

      my $conv = XML::Twig::unicode_convert( 'latin1');
      my $t = new XML::Twig(output_filter => $conv);

      warning: conversions work fine with XML::Parser 2.27 but sometimes fail
      with XML::Parser 2.30 (on Perl 5.6.1, Linux 2.4 on a PC) when using 
      'latin1' without Text::Iconv or Unicode::String and Unicode::Map8
      installed.

      The input_filter option works the same way, except the text is 
      converted before it is stored in the twig (so you can use regexp in 
      your native encoding for example) 

      the XML::Twig::Elt set_asis method sets a property of an element that
      causes it to be output asis (without XML-escaping < " and &) so you
      can still create tagged text

      the XML::Twig::Elt prefix and suffix methods accept an optional
      'asis' argument that causes the prefix or suffix to get the asis
      property (so you can do $elt->prefix( '<b>foo</b>', 'asis') for
      example)

      the XML::Twig and XML::Twig::Elt find_nodes methods are aliases
      to the get_xpath method (this is the name used in XML::XPath)

      the XML::Twig parseurl and safe_parseurl methods parse a document
      whose url is given

      XML::Twig::Elt extra_data, set_extra_data and append_extra_data to
      access the... extra data (PI's and comments) attached to an element

      XML::Twig method parser returns the XML::Parser::Expat object used
      by the twig 

      Most XML::Parser::Expat methods are now inherited by XML::Twig
      objects

      XML::Twig::Elt descendant_or_self method that returns the element
      and its descendants

    Fixed
      element (and attribute) names can now include '.'
      get_xpath now works for root based XPath expressions ('/doc/elt') 
      get_xpath now works for regexps (including regexps on attribute values)
      you can now properly restore pretty_print and empty_tag_style values
      speedup (at install) now checks the Perl version and uses qr or ""
        so XML::Twig works in 5.004 
      XML::Twig::Elt wrap_in now allows wrapping the root element

      various bugs in the DOCTYPE and DTD output with XML::Parser 2.30
      
      the tests to fix a bug when working with XML::Parser 2.27  
      the tests to fix a bug preventing test2 to pass under windows

      _default_  handlers now work (thanks Zoogie)

      the text method now returns the XML base entities (<>&'") un-escaped
      (thanks to Hakan Kallberg's persistence to ask for it ;--)

      pretty_print works better for elements without content

      end_tag_handlers now work properly (thanks to Phil Glanville for the
      patch).

    Enhanced

      Attributes which name starts with # are not output by the print
      methods, and thus can be used to store private data on elements

      WeakRef is used if installed, so no more memory leaks
 
      Sped-up print and flush by creating the _print and _flush methods 
      which do not check for file handle and pretty print options

      The doc has been enhanced and somewhat restructured. All options are
      now written as this_is_an_option although the legacy form thisIsAnOption
      can still be used. Links now display properly in the text form (thanks to
      Dominic Mitchell for spotting this and sending a patch)

      Navigation functions (including descendants) now allow not only a gi
      to be used as filter, but also the '#ELT' token, to filter only "real"
      elements (as opposed to #PCDATA, #CDATA, #PI, #COMMENT, #ENT), the 
      '#TEXT' token, to filter only text (PCDATA and CDATA elements), 
      regular expressions (built with qr//) applied on the elements gi's,
      code references, the code is passed the element as argument, and a
      subset of XPath.
      Functions that can use this token are: children, first_child, last_child,
      prev_sibling, last_sibling, next_elt, last_elt, descendants, get_xpath,
      child, sibling, sibling_text, prev_siblings, next_siblings field, 
      first_child_text

      The paste method now accepts a 'within' position, which inserts the
      element at the $offset argument (a 3rd, required, argument) in the
      reference element or in its first text child 

      The XML::Twig::Elt insert method now accepts attributes (hashrefs)
      applied to the element(s) being inserted:
      $elt->insert( e1 => { a => 'v'}, e2 => e3 => { a1 =>'v1', a2 => 'v2'}); 

      The XML::Twig::erase method now outputs a meaningful error message if
      applied to the root (or a cut element)

      Optimizations for better performances (in the end performances are about
      the same or a little worse than XML::Twig 2.02 but the module is much
      more powerful)

    Known bugs:

    The DTD interface is completely broken, and I have little hope of
    fixing it considering I have to deal with 2 incompatible versions of
    XML::Parser. Plus no one seems to be using it...

    Some XPath/Navigation expressions using " or ' in the text()="" part
    of the expression will cause a fatal error

    Note that this version works better (but doesn't necessarily require)
    with WeakRef (Perl version 5.6.0 and above) and Text::Iconv for all
    its encoding conversions.
