CHANGES

Changes in 3.15

      Fixes that allow the tests to pass on more systems (thanks to Ed
      Avis for his testing)

      Added normalize_space option for simplify (suggestion of Lambert Lum) 

      Removed usage of $&

      Expanded the doc for paste, as it was a bit short (suggestion of
      Richard Jolly)

Changes in 3.14

      Namespace processing has been enhanced and should work fine now,
      as long as twig_roots is not used.

      Potentially uncompatible change: the behaviour of simplify has
      been changed to mimic as exactly as possible XML::Simple's XMLin

      Completed the pod to cover the entire API
 
      Tests now pass with perl 5.005_04-RC1 (fail with 5.005 reported
      by David Claughton), added more tests and a config summary at the
      end of the tests

      Added methods on the class attribute, convenient for dealing with
      XHTML or preparing display with CSS:
      class set_class add_to_class att_to_class add_att_to_class 
      move_att_to_class tag_to_class add_tag_to_class set_tag_class in_class
      navigation functions can use '.<class>' expressions

      fixed (yet another!) bug in the way DTDs were output
      fixed bug for pi => 'drop' option

      changed the names of lots on internal (undocumented) methods, prefixed
      them with _

Changes in 3.13

      Maintenance release to get the tests to pass on various platforms

      updated the README
      fixed a problem with encoding conversions (using safe_encode and
      safe_encode_hex) under perl 5.8.0, see RT ticket #5111
      fixed tests to pass when trying to use an unsupported iconv filter    

Changes in 3.12

      New features and greatly increased test coverage

      added lots of tests (>900), thanks to David Rigaudiere, Forrest 
      Cahoon, Sebastien Aperghis-Tramoni, Henrik Tougaard and Sam Tregar
      for testing this release on various OSs, Perl, XML::Parser and 
      expat versions.

      added XML::Twig::XPath that uses XML::XPath as the XPath engine
      for findnodes, findnodes_as_string, findvalue, exists, find and
      matches. Just use XML::Twig::XPath instead of use XML::Twig;
      (see the tests in t/xmlxpath_*).

      Added special case to output some HTML tags ('script' to start with)
      as not empty.
      XML::Twig::Elt->new now properly flags empty elements (spotted by
      Dave Roe)
      added XML::Twig::Elt contains_a_single method
      added #ENT twig_handlers (not necessarily complete, so not yet
      documented, needs more tests)
      added doc for XML::Twig and XML::Twig::Elt subs_text methods
      tags starting with # are now "invisible" (they are not output),
      useful for example for pretty_printing
      added new options --wrap '' and --date to xml_grep
      improved XPath support (added [nb] support)
      added xpath method, which generates a unique XPath for an element
      added has_child and has_children as synonyms of first_child
      added XML::Twig::set_id_seed to control how generated id's are
      created

      when using ignore on an element, end_tag_handlers are now tested
      at the end of the element (so you can for exemple get the byte 
      offset in the document), suggestion of Philippe Verdret

      added XML::Twig::Elt change_att_name 
      XML::Twig::Elt new now properly works when called as an object
      (and not a class) method

      fixed namespace processing somewhat
      fixed SAX output methods
      fixed bug when keep_atts_order on and using set_att on an element
      with no existing attribute (spotted by scharloi) 

      WARNING - potentially incompatible changes -
      when using finish_print, the document used to be flushed. This is no
      longer the case, you will have to do it before calling finish_print. 
      This way you have the choice of doing it or not.

      Removed XML::Twig::Elt::unescape function (was no longer used)

Changes in 3.11

      added --text_only option to xml_grep (outputs the text of the
      result, without tags)

      fixed bug where "Comments [was] always dropped after a twig 
      object set 'comments' to 'drop'" (RT#3711), bug report and first
      patch by Simon Flack

      by popular demand, added option "keep_atts_order" that keeps the
      original attribute order in the output. This option needs the
      Tie::IxHash module to work.

Changes in 3.10

      added xml_pp xml_grep and xml_spellcheck to the distribution

      the print method now calls 'print $elt->sprint' instead of printing
      content as it converts them to text, in order to reduce the number
      of calls to Perl's print (which should increase performance)

      changed XML::Twig::Elt erase to allow erasing the root element 
      if it has only 1 child

      added findvalue method to XML::Twig and XML::Twig::Elt

      aliased findnodes to get_xpath in XML::Twig and XML::Twig::Elt

      added the elt_class option to XML::Twig::new

      added the do_not_chain_handlers option to XML::Twig::new

      added the XML::Twig::Elt is_first_child and is_last_child methods

      set_gi,set_text, prefix, suffix, set_att, set_atts, del_atts, del_att
      now return the element for easier chains

      Fixed a bug in pretty printing comments before elements (RT #2315)

      Added the XML::Twig::Elt children_copy method which returns a list
      of elements that are copies of the children of the element

      Fixed a bug in wrap_in when the element wrapped is not attached to a tree

      Fixed a bug with get_xpath: regexp modifiers were not taken into account
      spotted by Eric Safern (RT #2284)

      Fixed a bug in methods inherited from XML::Parser::Expat (arguments
      were not properly passed)

      Installed local empty SIG handlers to trap error messages triggered
      by require for optional modules, so that user signal handlers would
      not have to deal with them (suggestion from Philippe Verdret)

      Fixed a bug in the navigation XPath engine: text() was used instead of 
      string(). Both are now allowed.

      Added XML::Twig::Elt sort_children, sort_children_on_value, 
      sort_children_on_att and sort_children_on_field methods that sort the
      children of an element in place

      Added XML::Twig::Elt field_to_att and att_to_field methods

      Fixed a memory leak due to ids not being weak references

      Added the XML::Twig::Elt wrap_children method that wraps children
      of an element that satisfy a regexp in a new element

      Added the XML::Twig::Elt add_id method that adds an id to an element
      
      Added the XML::Twig::Elt strip_add method that deletes an attribute
      from an element and its descendants

      Fixed a quasi-bug in set_att where the hash passed in reference was
      used directly, which makes it a problem when the same reference is
      passed several times: all the elements share the same attributes.
      This is a potentially incompatible change for code that relied on 
      this feature. Please report problems to the author.

      fixed a bug in set_id

      fixed a bug spotted by Bill Gunter: allowed _ as the initial character 
      for XML names. Also now allow ':' as the first element

      added the simplify methods, which load a twig into an XML::Simple like 
      data structure

      fixed a bug in get_type and is_elt, spotted and fixed by Paul Stodghill

      added the XML::Twig::Elt ancestors_or_self method

      fixed bug when doc root is also a twig_root (twig was not built)

      updated the README (fleshed out examples, added OS X to the list of 
      tested platforms)

      fixed a bug when using the no_dtd_output option

      added doc for the XML::Twig::Elt children_count method

      added the XML::Twig::Elt children_text method

      updated the doc so it can be properly formated by my custom pod2html,
      the generated doc (with a bigger ToC and better links) is available
      from the XML::Twig page at http://xmltwig.com/xmltwig/
      
Changes in 3.09

      added XML::Twig::Elt xml_text method

      fixed several bugs in the split method under 5.8.0 when matching a utf8
      character (thanks to Dominic Mitchell who spotted them)

      cleaned-up the pod (still in progress)

      added the XML::Twig::Elt pos method that gives the position of
      an element in its parent's child list

      re-introduced parseurl (thanks to Denis Kolokol for spotting its 
      absence in this version)

      Fixed a bug: ent_tag_handlers were not called on the root (thanks
      to Philippe Verdret

      Improved #PI (also declared as '?') and #COMMENT handler support 

      added check on reference type (must be XML::Twig::Elt) in 
      XML::Twig::Elt::paste (patch by Forrest Cahoon)

Changes in 3.08

      The previous fix wasn't enough :--( 

Changes in 3.07

      Fixed the way weaken is imported from Scalar::Util

Changes in 3.06

      Added XML::Twig::Elt trimmed_text and related methods (trimmed_field,
      first_child_trimmed_text, last_child_trimmed_text...)

      Added XML::Twig::Elt replace_with method

      Added XML::Twig::Elt cut_children method

      Added XML::Twig contains_only method

      Added *[att=~ /regexp/] condition type (suggested by Nikola Janceski)

      Fixed a bug in the way handlers for gi, path and subpath were chained
      (Thanks to Tommy Wareing)

      Fixed a bug where entities caused an error on other handlers (Thanks
      to Tommy Wareing)

      Fixed a bug with string(sub_elt)=~ /regexp/ (thanks to Tommy Wareing)

      Fixed a bug with output_filter used with expand_external_entities
      (thanks to Tommy Wareing)

      Fixed (yet another!) bug with whitespace handling (whitespace, then an
      entity made the whitespace move after the entity) (spotted by the usual
      Tommy Wareing)

      Added an error message when pasting on an undef reference (suggestion
      of Tommy Wareing)

      Fixed a bug in in_context (found by Tommy Wareing)

      Fixed a bug when loading the DTD (local undef $/ did not stay local,
      bug found and patch sent by Steve Pomeroy and Henry Cipolla)

      Fixed a bug in setting output filter

      Fixed a bug in using a filehandle with twig_print_outside_roots

      Added safe_encode_hex filter

      fixed bug in set_indent, $INDENT not set properly (thanks
      to Eric Jain)

      fixed dependencies (no check with 5.8.0, added Scalar::Util
      as a possible source for weaken)

      Added no_prolog option to XML:Twig::new

      Tested build on Windows (thanks to Cory Trese and Josh Hawkins)


    Changed in 3.05

      Added _ALPHA_ SAX export methods: 
        XML::Twig toSAX1, toSAX2, flush_toSAX1, flush_toSAX2
	XML::Twig::Elt toSAX1, toSAX2

      The following gotchas apply:

        - these methods work only for documents that are completely
          loaded by XML::Twig (ie if you use twig_roots the data
          outside of the roots will not be output as SAX). 
        - SAX1 support is a bit dodgy: the encoding is not preserved
	  (it is always set to 'UTF-8'),
	- locator is not supported (and probably will not, what's the 
	  location of a newly created element?)

      Also when exporting SAX you should consider setting Twig to a 
      mode where all aspects of the XML are treated as nodes by XML::Twig,
      by setting the following options when you create the twig:
      comments => 'process', pi => 'process', keep_spaces => 1
       
     
      twig_print_outside_roots now supports a file handle ref as argument:
      the untouched part of the tree will be output to the filehandle:

      Added the 'indented_c' style that gives a slightly more compact pretty
      print than 'indented': the end tags are on the same line as the 
      preceeding text (suggestion of Hugh Myers)
     
      Added option in get_xpath (aka find_nodes) to apply the query to
      a list of elements 

      Added processing of conditions on the current node in get_xpath:
      my @result= get_xpath( q{.[@att="val"]});
      This is of course mostly useful with the previous option.
      The idea stemmed from a post from Liam Quin to the perl-xml list

      Added XML::Twig xml_version, set_xml_version, standalone, set_standalone
      methods on the XML declaration

      Fixed a bug in change_gi (which simply did not work at all), found
      by Ron Hayden.

      Fixed bug in space handling with CDATA (spaces before the CDATA section
      were moved to within the section), comments and PI's

      Fixed bug in parse_url (exit was not called at the end of the child),
      found by David Kulp

      Cleanup a bit the code that parses xpath expressions (still some work 
      to be done on this though), fixed a bug with last, found by Roel de Cock

      Fixed the SYNOPSIS (parsefile is used to parse files, spotted by 
      e.sammer)

      Fixed a bug in pretty printing (reported by Zhu Zhou)

      Fixed a bugin the install: the Makefile now uses the same perl used 
      to perl Makefile.PL to run speedup and check_optional_modules 
      (reported by Ralf Santos)

      Fixed bugs in pretty printing when using flush, trying to figure out
      as well as possible if an element contains other elements or text 
      (there is still a gotcha, see the BUGS section in the docs) 

      Fixed a bug that caused the XML declaration and the DTD not to be reset
      between parses

      Improved the conversion functions (errors are now reported when the
      function is created and not when it is first used)

      Added the output_encoding option to XML::Twig->new, which allows 
      specifying an encoding for the output: the conversion filter is
      created using Encode (perl 5.8.0) Text::Iconv or Unicode::* The
      XML declaration is also updated

      #CDATA and #ENT can now be used in handler expressions

      added XML::Twig::Elt remove_cdata method, which turns CDATA sections
      into regular PCDATA elements

      set_asis can now be used to output CDATA sections un-escaped (and without
      the CDATA section markers) 

    Changed in 3.04

      Fixed handlers for XML::Parser 2.27 so the module can pass the tests

    Changed in 3.03

      fixed bugs in entity handling in twig_roots mode

      added the ignore_elts option, to skip completely elements

      enhanced the XPath-like syntax in navigation and get_xpath
      methods: added operators (>, < ...)

      fixed [RT 168]: setTwigHandler failed when no handler was already set
      (thanks to Jerry)
      
      turned %valid_option into a package global so AnyData can access it
      
      fixed a bug in sprint that prevented it from working with filters

      fixed a bug in erase when erasing an empty element that was the
      last child of its parent ([RT390], thanks to Julian Arnold)
      
      copy now correctly copies the asis status of elements

      fixed typos on the docs (thanks to Shlomo Yona)

      added tests (for erase and entities in twig_roots mode)

    Changed in 3.02

      Tweaked speedup to replace constructs that did not work in
      perl 5.005003

    Changed in 3.01
    
      Fixed the directory name in the tar file 

    Changed in 3.00

      WARNING: THIS CHANGE IS NOT BACKWARD COMPATIBLE

      But it is The Right Thing To Do

      In normal mode (when KeepEncoding is not used) the XML data is
      now stored as parsed by XML::Parser, ie the base entities are
      expanded. The "print" methods (print, sprint and flush, plus the
      new xml_string, pcdata_xml_string and att_xml_string) return the
      data in XML-escaped form: & and < are escaped in PCDATA and
      &, < and the quote (" by default) are turned to &amp; &lt; and
      &quot; (or &apos; if the quote is '). The "text" methods (text,
      att and pcdata) return the stored text as is.
      So if you want to output XML you should use the "print" methods
      and if you want to output text you should use the "text" methods.

      Note that this breaks the trick consisting in adding tags to the
      content of an element: $elt->prefix( "<b>") no longer adds a <b>
      tag before an element. $elt->print will now output "&lt;b>...".
      (but you can still use it by marking those elements as 'asis').
      It also fixes the annoying &apos; thingie that used to replace '
      in the data. 

      When the KeepEncoding option is used this is not true, the data
      is stored asis, base entities are kept un-escaped.

      Note that KeepEncoding is a global setting, if you use several twigs,
      some with KeepEncoding and some without then you will have to manually
      set the option using the set_keep_encoding method, otherwise the last
      XML::Twig::new call will have set it

      In addition when the KeepEncoding option is used the start tag is
      parsed using a custom function parse_start_tag, which works only
      for 1-byte encodings (it is regexp-based). This method can be 
      overridden using the ParseStartTag (or parse_start_tag) option
      when creating the twig. This function takes the original string as
      input and returns the gi and the attributes (in a hash).
      If you write a function that works for multi-byte encodings I would
      very much appreciate if you could send it back to me so I can add it
      to the module, so other users can benefit from it.

     An additional option ExpansExternalEnts will expand external entity
     references to their text (in the output, the text stored is &ent;).

    Added

      When handlers (twig_handlers or start_tag_handlers) are called
      $_ is set to the element node, so quick hacks look better:
      
      my $t= new XML::Twig( twig_handlers => 
               { elt => sub { print $_->att( 'id'), ": ", $_->text, "\n"; } }
	                  );

      XML::Twig dispose method which properly reclaims all the memory
        used by the object (useful if you don't have WeakRef installed)

      XML::Twig and XML::Twig::Elt ignore methods, which can be called
        from a start_tag_handlers handler and cause the element (or the
        current element if called on a twig) to be ignored by the 
        parsing

      XML::Twig parse_start_tag option that overrides the default function
        used to parse start tags when KeepEncoding is used

      XML::Twig::Elt xml_string, pcdata_xml_string and att_xml_string
        all return an XML-escaped string for an element (including 
	sub-elements and their tags but not the enclosing tags for the 
	element), a #PCDATA element and an attribute

      XML::Twig::Elt methods tag and set_tag, equivalent respectively
        to gi and set_gi
      
      XML::Twig and XML::Twig::Elt set_keep_encoding methods can be used
        to set the keep_encoding value if you use several twigs with 
        different keep_encoding options

      Option names for XML::Twig::new are now checked (a warning is output
        if the option is not a valid one);

      when using pretty_print nice or indented keep_spaces_in is now checked
        so the elements within an element listed in keep_spaces_in are not
        indented

      XML::Twig::Elt insert_new_elt method that does a new and a paste

      XML::Twig::Elt split_at method splits a #PCDATA element in 2

      XML::Twig::Elt split method splits all the text descendants of an 
        element, on a regep, wrapping text captured in brackets in the
        regexp in a specified element, all elements are returned 

      XML::Twig::Elt mark method is similar to the split method, except
        that only newly created elements (matched by the regexp) are
        returned

      XML::Twig::Elt get_type method returns #ELT for elements and the gi
        (#PCDATA, #CDATA...) otherwise

      XML::Twig::Elt is_elt returns the gi if the element is a real element
         and 0 if it is #PCDATA, #CDATA...
      
      XML::Twig::Elt contains_only_text returns 1 if the element contains no
         "real" element (is_field is another name for it)

      First implementation of the output_filter option which filters the
      text before it is output by the print, sprint, flush and text methods
      (only works for print at the moment, and still under test with various
      versions of XML::Parser). Standard filters are also available

      Example:
        
        #!/bin/perl -w
        use strict;
        use XML::Twig;

        my $t = new XML::Twig(output_filter => 'latin1');
        $t->parse( \*DATA);
        $t->print;
 
        __DATA__
        <?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>
        <docé té="valué">Un homme soupçonné d'être impliqué dans la mort 
             d'un motard de la police, renversé</docé>

      The 'latin1', 'html' and 'safe' filters are predefined, you can also
      build additional filters using Iconv (requires text::Iconv) and 
      Unicode::String (requires Unicode::String and Unicode::Map8):

      my $conv = XML::Twig::iconv_convert( 'latin1');
      my $t = new XML::Twig(output_filter => $conv);

      my $conv = XML::Twig::unicode_convert( 'latin1');
      my $t = new XML::Twig(output_filter => $conv);

      warning: conversions work fine with XML::Parser 2.27 but sometimes fail
      with XML::Parser 2.30 (on Perl 5.6.1, Linux 2.4 on a PC) when using 
      'latin1' without Text::Iconv or Unicode::String and Unicode::Map8
      installed.

      The input_filter option works the same way, except the text is 
      converted before it is stored in the twig (so you can use regexp in 
      your native encoding for example) 

      the XML::Twig::Elt set_asis method sets a property of an element that
      causes it to be output asis (without XML-escaping < " and &) so you
      can still create tagged text

      the XML::Twig::Elt prefix and suffix methods accept an optional
      'asis' argument that causes the prefix or suffix to get the asis
      property (so you can do $elt->prefix( '<b>foo</b>', 'asis') for
      example)

      the XML::Twig and XML::Twig::Elt find_nodes methods are aliases
      to the get_xpath method (this is the name used in XML::XPath)

      the XML::Twig parseurl and safe_parseurl methods parse a document
      whose url is given

      XML::Twig::Elt extra_data, set_extra_data and append_extra_data to
      access the... extra data (PI's and comments) attached to an element

      XML::Twig method parser returns the XML::Parser::Expat object used
      by the twig 

      Most XML::Parser::Expat methods are now inherited by XML::Twig
      objects

      XML::Twig::Elt descendant_or_self method that returns the element
      and its descendants

    Fixed
      element (and attribute) names can now include '.'
      get_xpath now works for root based XPath expressions ('/doc/elt') 
      get_xpath now works for regexps (including regexps on attribute values)
      you can now properly restore pretty_print and empty_tag_style values
      speedup (at install) now checks the Perl version and uses qr or ""
        so XML::Twig works in 5.004 
      XML::Twig::Elt wrap_in now allows wrapping the root element

      various bugs in the DOCTYPE and DTD output with XML::Parser 2.30
      
      the tests to fix a bug when working with XML::Parser 2.27  
      the tests to fix a bug preventing test2 to pass under windows

      _default_  handlers now work (thanks Zoogie)

      the text method now returns the XML base entities (<>&'") un-escaped
      (thanks to Hakan Kallberg's persistence to ask for it ;--)

      pretty_print works better for elements without content

      end_tag_handlers now work properly (thanks to Phil Glanville for the
      patch).

    Enhanced

      Attributes which name starts with # are not output by the print
      methods, and thus can be used to store private data on elements

      WeakRef is used if installed, so no more memory leaks
 
      Sped-up print and flush by creating the _print and _flush methods 
      which do not check for file handle and pretty print options

      The doc has been enhanced and somewhat restructured. All options are
      now written as this_is_an_option although the legacy form thisIsAnOption
      can still be used. Links now display properly in the text form (thanks to
      Dominic Mitchell for spotting this and sending a patch)

      Navigation functions (including descendants) now allow not only a gi
      to be used as filter, but also the '#ELT' token, to filter only "real"
      elements (as opposed to #PCDATA, #CDATA, #PI, #COMMENT, #ENT), the 
      '#TEXT' token, to filter only text (PCDATA and CDATA elements), 
      regular expressions (built with qr//) applied on the elements gi's,
      code references, the code is passed the element as argument, and a
      subset of XPath.
      Functions that can use this token are: children, first_child, last_child,
      prev_sibling, last_sibling, next_elt, last_elt, descendants, get_xpath,
      child, sibling, sibling_text, prev_siblings, next_siblings field, 
      first_child_text

      The paste method now accepts a 'within' position, which inserts the
      element at the $offset argument (a 3rd, required, argument) in the
      reference element or in its first text child 

      The XML::Twig::Elt insert method now accepts attributes (hashrefs)
      applied to the element(s) being inserted:
      $elt->insert( e1 => { a => 'v'}, e2 => e3 => { a1 =>'v1', a2 => 'v2'}); 

      The XML::Twig::erase method now outputs a meaningful error message if
      applied to the root (or a cut element)

      Optimizations for better performances (in the end performances are about
      the same or a little worse than XML::Twig 2.02 but the module is much
      more powerful)

    Known bugs:

    The DTD interface is completely broken, and I have little hope of
    fixing it considering I have to deal with 2 incompatible versions of
    XML::Parser. Plus no one seems to be using it...

    Some XPath/Navigation expressions using " or ' in the text()="" part
    of the expression will cause a fatal error

    Note that this version works better (but doesn't necessarily require)
    with WeakRef (Perl version 5.6.0 and above) and Text::Iconv for all
    its encoding conversions.
