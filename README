NAME

    XML::Twig - Tree interface to XML documents allowing processing chunk
                by chunk of huge documents.

WARNING

  If you are upgrading from XML::Twig 2.02 please look at the Changes file
  for important information about potential incompatibilities between the 2 
  versions.
                

SUMMARY (see perldoc XML::Twig for full details)


    single-tree mode    
        my $t= XML::Twig->new();
        $t->parsefile( 'doc.xml');
        $t->print;

    chunk mode 
        my $t= XML::Twig->new( TwigHandlers => { section => \&flush});
        $t->parsefile( 'doc.xml');
        $t->flush;
        sub flush { $_[0]->flush; }
    
    sub-tree mode 
        # print all title's in the document
        my $t= XML::Twig->new( TwigRoots => { title => 1 },
                               TwigHandlers => { title => \&list});
        $t->parsefile( 'doc.xml');
        sub list { print $_->print . "\n"; }
    
INSTALLATION

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

NOTES

   It is very much recommended to install Text::Iconv (for easy character
   encoding conversions) and WeakRef (to avoid memory leaks) with this version
   if you can.
